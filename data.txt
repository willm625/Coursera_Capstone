 Out of the dataset, I will be using attributes such as report number, address type, roadcond, lightcond, speeding, and st_coldesc. The report number would just be for identification. ADDRTYPE tells whether the collision occurred in an alley, block, or intersection. ROADCOND describes the condition of the road. The Speeding column will tell if a car was going over the speed limit or not. The light condition column tells whether it was dark or bright outside, and also if the street light was functioning properly. STCOLDESC tells what the two cars were doing. For each attribute, I could find how likely a collision is for each value. I plan to split the data into train and test, and then find correlations between key features to make a model.
