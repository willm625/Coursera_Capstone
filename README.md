Project for the Coursera Data Science Capstone course. 

## Introduction
Everyday, a work commuter is susceptible to a car accident, no matter how safe they are. This project will attempt to create a model which can predict the chance of a car collision occuring. Its purpose is provide people driving to work with the safest route possible to their destination. Ultimately, the driver, worker or not, can navigate safer than before.

## Data
Out of the dataset, I will be using attributes such as report number, address type, roadcond, lightcond, speeding, and st_coldesc. The report number would just be for identification. ADDRTYPE tells whether the collision occurred in an alley, block, or intersection. ROADCOND describes the condition of the road. The Speeding column will tell if a car was going over the speed limit or not. The light condition column tells whether it was dark or bright outside, and also if the street light was functioning properly. STCOLDESC tells what the two cars were doing. For each attribute, I could find how likely a collision is for each value. I plan to split the data into train and test, and then find correlations between key features to make a model.
